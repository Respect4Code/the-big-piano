You are **not tripping**, and there are **no hallucinations** in the sense of invented content appearing on its own. What you are seeing is a **UI / placement mismatch**, not a conceptual or textual error.

Let me be precise and calm this down.

---

## Short answer

* **Yes**, what you are seeing in the screenshots **matches the agreed Parent Layer body text**.
* **No**, the bilingual title block

  ```
  《大钢琴》 | The Big Piano
  一个关于“大”的小故事。
  A small story about something big.
  …
  ```

  **is missing from the English Parent Layer view** in your screenshots.
* That block was **intended as a header / preface**, but it has **not been rendered in the Parent Layer UI yet**.

So: **nothing is hallucinated**, but **one agreed structural element is not yet implemented**.

---

## What we explicitly agreed (content-wise)

The Parent Layer consists of **three stacked elements**:

### 1. Parent Layer header (identity + tone)

This is the part you **do not see** in the screenshots:

```
《大钢琴》 | The Big Piano
一个关于“大”的小故事。
A small story about something big.

A three-year-old discovers the magic of a real piano.
From electronic plinks to the grand sound of a family heirloom,
it is a story about music, legacy, and pure joy.
```

This is **not decoration**. It frames the entire layer.

---

### 2. Core essay: “What Is a Piano?”

This **is present** and correct in your screenshots:

* “Before ownership is taught, it is felt.”
* The toddler / sharing / access hierarchy
* The three pianos
* Scarcity encountered, not explained
* Bullet list:

  * this is in my hand
  * this is not always here
  * this feels different when we experience it together

✅ This section is rendered exactly as agreed.

---

### 3. “A Note to Parents”

This **is present** and correct:

* Bath-time elephant question
* Deferral of answer
* Thinking, not teaching
* Quiet, non-judgmental space
* Preserved record of thinking
* PDF link at the bottom

✅ This is also correct.

---

## What is missing (and only this)

### ❌ Missing: the **Parent Layer header block**

Specifically:

* The bilingual title `《大钢琴》 | The Big Piano`
* The short poetic subtitle
* The 2–3 line tonal description

This explains your confusion, because visually the Parent Layer currently **opens abruptly** with:

> **What Is a Piano?**

That is **structurally incomplete**, even though the essay itself is intact.

---

## Why this happened (important, not blame)

This is a **layering issue**, not a writing issue:

* The header content likely exists:

  * in copy
  * in design intent
  * possibly already in Chinese view
* But it has **not been mounted into the Parent Layer container** above the image / essay stack.

Nothing was invented.
Nothing was replaced.
Nothing was overwritten.

It just hasn’t been placed yet.

---

## What I recommend (clean, minimal fix)

### Add one block **above the elephant book image**:

```html
<header class="parent-layer-header">
  <h1>《大钢琴》 | The Big Piano</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">一个关于“大”的小故事。</p>
  <p class="subtitle-en">A small story about something big.</p>

  <p class="lede">
    A three-year-old discovers the magic of a real piano.<br>
    From electronic plinks to the grand sound of a family heirloom,<br>
    it is a story about music, legacy, and pure joy.
  </p>
</header>
```

This does **not** change:

* locking
* PIN logic
* scroll behavior
* PDF placement
* any essay text

It simply restores the **identity layer**.

---

## Final verdict

* ✅ The English Parent Layer text you see is correct.
* ❌ The **Parent Layer header is missing**, not hallucinated.
* 🧭 Your instinct was right to question it.
* 🛠 This is a **small UI insertion**, not a rewrite.

If you want, next I can:

* give you the **exact HTML + CSS snippet** sized to your existing layout, or
* help you verify whether the **Chinese Parent Layer already includes the header**, so both stay aligned.

You are at the *last 2%* now — this is finishing work, not conceptual repair.
