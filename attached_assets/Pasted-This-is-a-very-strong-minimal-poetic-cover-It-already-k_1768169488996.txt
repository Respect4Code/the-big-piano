This is a very strong, minimal, poetic cover. It already **knows** how it wants to live in the app. The structure should respect its silence and gravity.

I’ll answer in three layers: **Meaning → Navigation → Screen Design.**

---

## 1. What this page *is*

> **大象为什么发出声音？**
> Why does the elephant make a sound?

This is not a title page.
It is a **threshold question**.

It should function as:

* a door into the story
* a moment of stillness
* a child-facing question
* and a parent-facing echo

So in the app, it should not sit inside a list of chapters like content.
It should live as a **question screen**.

---

## 2. How it should be structured in the app

### Story Layer Flow

```
[ Cover Question Screen ]
大象为什么发出声音？

      ↓ tap / swipe

[ Story Text Begins ]
Why did the elephant make a noise?
Because the elephant had a feeling...
```

The question is not part of the story.
It is the **invitation into the story.**

---

## 3. Visual Structure (exact recommendation)

### Screen 1 — Question Screen

Centered, vertical, quiet.

Chinese first, English small underneath:

```
大象为什么发出声音？

Why does the elephant make a sound?
```

No buttons.
No explanation.
Just a soft hint at the bottom:

> 轻轻滑动
> Swipe gently

This mirrors how a child would approach the question.

---

### Screen 2 — First Paragraph

Now the story begins in **child voice mode**.

English or Chinese depending on language toggle.

---

## 4. Where this sits in the app hierarchy

It should live inside:

**Story Library → Elephant → Question Gate**

Not inside:

* Parent Layer
* Archive
* PDF
* Research

Because this is **pure story energy**, not commentary.

---

## 5. How it connects to Parent Layer

After the story finishes, the app can gently offer:

> 父母阅读区
> Parent Reflection

Inside Parent Layer:

* Show the same question again
* But now paired with:

  * the piano history
  * ivory
  * vibration
  * Bitcoin block
  * ethics
  * material memory

So the same question becomes:

* Child Layer → wonder
* Parent Layer → responsibility

---

## 6. Why this structure matters

Because:

* Children meet the question without answers.
* Parents meet the same question with history.
* The app becomes a **bridge, not a teacher.**

That is your monopoly logic.

---

## 7. Final design principle

> **The question is the UI.**

Not a button.
Not a label.
Not a menu item.

It is the **first experience of the story**.

---

## 8. One sentence summary

**Structure it as a full-screen question gate that the user enters through, not as a title inside the story.**

---

If you want, next I can:

* map the full Elephant story flow screen by screen
* design the bilingual toggle behavior
* or design how the Parent Layer mirrors this exact question visually

But structurally:
This page should be treated as a **threshold**, not as content.
