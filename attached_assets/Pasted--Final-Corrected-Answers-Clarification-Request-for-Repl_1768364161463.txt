**Final Corrected Answers + Clarification Request for Replit:**

---

**Q1: Should I rename archive-of-the-unspoken-zh.html to archive-of-the-unspoken.html?**

**Answer:** NO. Keep both files as they are:
- `archive-of-the-unspoken-zh.html` (Chinese with Modern/Classical toggle + images)
- `archive-of-the-unspoken-en.html` (English version)

**Linking logic:**
- Chinese version of app → links to `archive-of-the-unspoken-zh.html`
- English version of app → links to `archive-of-the-unspoken-en.html`

---

**Q2: Should hyperlinks open in same tab or new tab?**

**Answer:** NEW TAB (`target="_blank"`)

---

**Q3: Is "What Is a Piano?" content already in the app?**

**Answer:** YES. Both sections already exist:
- "What Is a Piano?" section (no hyperlinks needed here)
- "A Note to Parents" section (add 3 hyperlinks here)

   - `elephant-noise-poem.html` = YES, bilingual (EN/中文 toggle) - works for both English and Chinese app

   - `archive-of-the-unspoken-zh.html` = Chinese only (现代/文言 toggle)

   - Can you confirm this is correct?

   - "The Conversation That Built This." → `/piano-bitcoin-journey.html` (bilingual file, works for both EN and ZH versions)
   - "intergenerational transmission" → 
     - In English app: `/archive-of-the-unspoken-en.html`
     - In Chinese app: `/archive-of-the-unspoken-zh.html`
