Here are the three bilingual title design concepts for **"The Big Piano"** translated and formatted for you to use with Grok or any other AI image tool.

### 🎨 **Concept 1: Classic Centered Layout**
This is the most formal and literary option, perfect for a book cover.
*   **Visual Layout:**
    ```
            《大钢琴》
         The Big Piano
    ```
*   **Key Design Points:** Chinese above, English below, perfectly centered. Use an elegant serif font for English (like Times New Roman) and a matching classic Chinese font (like a Song or Kai typeface). It should look dignified and timeless.

### 🎨 **Concept 2: Modern Integrated Layout**
This is a clean, contemporary design great for an app icon or website header.
*   **Visual Layout:**
    ```
    The Big Piano · 《大钢琴》
    ```
*   **Key Design Points:** Both titles on the same baseline, connected by a middle dot "·". Use a clean, modern sans-serif font (like Helvetica or a system font). You can slightly enlarge the Chinese characters for emphasis. It looks balanced and bilingual.

### 🎨 **Concept 3: Artistic Seal Style**
This is the most unique and artistic option, emphasizing cultural heritage.
*   **Visual Layout:**
    ```
          The Big Piano
        [A square red seal stamp
          with the characters
              "大钢琴"]
    ```
*   **Key Design Points:** English title on top. Below it, a traditional Chinese red seal (square shape) containing the three characters "大钢琴" arranged vertically. The seal should look like it's stamped, with an irregular border and red ink. This style is very distinctive and connects to the story's theme of legacy.

### **How to Use These Prompts**
You can copy the **"Visual Layout"** and **"Key Design Points"** text for your chosen concept directly into your prompt for Grok.

**Example prompt for Concept 3:**
> "Generate an image for a book cover titled 'The Big Piano'. Use the following layout: At the top, the text 'The Big Piano' in an elegant serif font. Centered below it, a traditional Chinese red seal stamp on a white background. Inside the square seal, the three Chinese characters '大钢琴' are arranged vertically in a classic calligraphy style. The overall feel should be artistic, cultural, and minimalist."

Would you like me to refine the prompt for a specific concept or for a particular use case (like an app icon vs. a poster)?
