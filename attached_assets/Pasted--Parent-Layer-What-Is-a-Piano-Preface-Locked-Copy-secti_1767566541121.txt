    <h2>What Is a Piano?</h2>

    <p><strong>Before ownership is taught, it is felt.</strong></p>

    <p>My toddler is at the stage where “mine” arrives long before “yours.”<br>
    Shoes. A ball. A book.</p>

    <p>They are learning to map the world between what feels like theirs, and what belongs to others:<br>
    mummy’s brush, daddy’s shoes.</p>

    <p>This sense isn’t explained. It emerges.<br>
    It’s physical, immediate, and absolute.</p>

    <p>Naturally, this creates friction.<br>
    The logic of sharing is foreign. Why give up what you’re holding?<br>
    Why can’t you have what you want, right now?</p>

    <p>The concept of patience is just a word.<br>
    And it should be. Their world is the present moment.</p>

    <p>What fascinates me is the briefness of this early “ownership.”<br>
    A toy is clutched tightly in conflict, then discarded moments later.<br>
    The desire evaporates with access.</p>

    <p>It’s not about keeping.<br>
    It’s about the act of having had.</p>

    <p>At the same time, the word “share” is beginning to appear —<br>
    not as a moral rule, but as a social tool.</p>

    <p>“Daddy, share,” they say, even while reaching for what I hold.<br>
    They use it with other toddlers, too.</p>

    <p>I think they’re noticing it softens conflict.<br>
    They see it works before they understand why.</p>

    <p>This is where the pianos quietly entered our world.</p>

    <p>My toddler has their own piano. A small 37-key keyboard.<br>
    It’s always there, to be played or ignored.<br>
    It is unquestionably theirs.</p>

    <p>I have a piano, too. A small, weighted keyboard.<br>
    At first, it was mine.<br>
    Then it became shared.<br>
    Slowly, without any decree, it began to feel like ours.</p>

    <p>Then there is the Big Piano.<br>
    The full-sized one in my sister’s study.</p>

    <p>My toddler has no access to it unless we visit.<br>
    It exists elsewhere, and only sometimes.</p>

    <p>I didn’t plan this, but I see now we created a natural hierarchy:</p>

    <p>Their toy piano — always available<br>
    My shared piano — accessible, negotiated<br>
    The big piano — rare, permission-bound</p>

    <p>I never had to explain scarcity.<br>
    My toddler encountered it.</p>

    <p>The Big Piano mattered differently.<br>
    Not because it was technically better —<br>
    but because it wasn’t always accessible.</p>

    <p>At this stage, ownership isn’t legal or ethical.<br>
    It isn’t about rights or fairness.</p>

    <p>It is about:</p>

    <ul class="parent-bullets">
      <li>this is in my hand</li>
      <li>this is not always here</li>
      <li>this feels different when we experience it together</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That felt experience — not a lesson — is the foundation.</p>

    <p>And from this simple, personal hierarchy,<br>
    a much larger story about materials, history, and value begins to unfold.</p>

    <h2>A Note to Parents</h2>

    <p>What you are about to read next (elsewhere in this app) is a record of my thinking as a father.</p>

    <p>One evening at bath time, my child asked me,<br>
    “Why did the elephant make a noise?”</p>

    <p>They were standing in the bath, looking at their toy elephant by the taps.<br>
    They picked it up, stroked it, played with its tusks and long trunk,<br>
    and waited for me to tell them a story.</p>

    <p>In that moment, I realised they weren’t asking for an answer.<br>
    They were thinking.<br>
    They were storytelling.<br>
    Or asking me to make up a story called Why the Elephant Made a Noise.</p>

    <p>I told them I would tell it the following night.</p>

    <p>In the meantime, their love for elephants forced me to confront the history of piano keys.<br>
    I was perplexed.</p>

    <p>I needed a quiet, non-judgmental space to sort out my thoughts —<br>
    from materials to ethics,<br>
    from technology to value.</p>

    <p>What comes next is not a lesson.<br>
    It is not polished.<br>
    It is not complete.</p>

    <p>It is a preserved record of thinking,<br>
    kept here for a day in the future.</p>
