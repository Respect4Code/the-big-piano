Best, given everything you’ve said (no preaching, access-not-possession, parent-as-observer, and you want one clean artifact you can ship now):

### My recommendation

**Use the “locked HTML block” approach**, and keep the Parent Layer as a **single scrollable document behind the PIN**, with **one image at the top**.

Why this is best (in practical product terms):

* **You control the voice.** No model “helpfully” rewriting your text later.
* **It will render consistently on mobile** (spacing, line breaks, bullets), which is where parents will actually read it.
* **It keeps the app’s ethos intact:** one artifact, no extra framing, no “Status” section, no meta.
* **It keeps “access” as the core concept**—the copy already does that, and the HTML preserves it exactly.
* **It’s future-proof:** later you can add a PDF link *after* “A Note to Parents” without changing a word.

### Image choice

Use **one image**, not multiple. The image should act like a quiet “cover” for the Parent Layer.

* If you’re choosing between **dark vs light** versions:
  **Pick the dark one** *if your app background is dark* (it will feel native and calm).
  **Pick the light one** *if your app background is white/light* (it will feel clean and editorial).

If you tell me whether your Parent Layer background is dark or light, I’ll tell you definitively which one to use.

### Replit prompt vs HTML

* If you want the fastest path with the least room for Replit to improvise: **paste the HTML directly.**
* If you need Replit to wire it into an existing PIN gate component/page: use the **Replit prompt**, but still provide the HTML and say:
  “Insert this HTML as-is inside the Parent Layer container.”

### One micro-adjustment I’d keep

Your change to “could not be possessed or easily accessed” was directionally correct, but **you don’t need “possessed” at all**. The cleanest, most “you” version is:

> “but because it wasn’t always accessible.”

That line already carries the entire moment of leaving, denial, rarity, and longing—without importing “possession.”

If you want, I’ll return your final copy again with that single line set exactly how you prefer, and nothing else changed.
