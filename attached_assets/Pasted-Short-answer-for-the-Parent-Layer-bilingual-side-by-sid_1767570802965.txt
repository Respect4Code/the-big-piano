Short answer: **for the Parent Layer, bilingual side-by-side *hinders* more than it helps.**
What you are sensing is correct, and there are **no hallucinations** in what you’re seeing — there is, however, a **structural mismatch** between intent and presentation.

Let me break this down cleanly.

---

## 1. Are there hallucinations?

**No.**
What’s on screen matches the content you approved *in substance*.

However, one thing **is missing in the English Parent Layer view** that *you explicitly intended to be there*:

> **《大钢琴》 | The Big Piano**
> 一个关于“大”的小故事。
> *A small story about something big.*
>
> *A three-year-old discovers the magic of a real piano…*

In your screenshots, the **body text is present**, but the **introductory framing block** is either:

* rendered only once (above the image), or
* visually de-emphasised compared to how strongly you conceptually treat it.

So your discomfort is not imagined — it’s a **presentation hierarchy issue**, not a content error.

That block is doing *identity work*. It should feel like a title page, not a caption.

## 2. Does bilingual text help or hinder in the Parent Layer?

### For children: bilingual can help

### For parents: bilingual **dilutes**

And this Parent Layer is explicitly **not** for the child.

### Why bilingual side-by-side hinders here

1. **This layer is reflective, not instructional**
   Parents read it slowly, emotionally, often late at night.
   Doubling the text:

   * breaks rhythm
   * interrupts tone
   * shifts the brain into “comparison / translation mode”

2. **It weakens voice authority**
   This text works because it feels *singular* and *confident*.
   Side-by-side languages subtly introduce:

   > “Which is the original?”
   > “Which is canonical?”

   That’s not what you want here.

3. **You already have a language switch**
   Your UI clearly shows:

   * English
   * 中文

   That is the *correct* place for bilingualism — **at the mode level**, not the paragraph level.

---

## 3. What is the correct model for the Parent Layer?

**One language per mode. Fully. Cleanly.**

### English Parent Mode

* Entire Parent Layer in English
* English typography, rhythm, pacing
* No Chinese interleaved

### Chinese Parent Mode

* Entire Parent Layer in Chinese
* Thoughtful literary Chinese (which you already have)
* No English interleaved

This mirrors how serious books, museums, and exhibitions handle bilingual content.

It signals:

> “This text matters enough to stand on its own.”

---

## 4. Where *should* bilingual coexist?

Two places only:

### A. The title header (optional, tasteful)

This works because it’s symbolic, not cognitive:

```
《大钢琴》 | The Big Piano
```

That’s identity, not reading load.

### B. The child-facing layer

There, bilingualism is playful, normalising, curiosity-driven.

The Parent Layer is different. It’s private. Adult. Reflective.

---

## 5. What I recommend you do next (very concrete)

### 1. Parent Layer: split by language

* English mode → English only
* 中文模式 → 中文 only

### 2. Elevate the intro block visually

Treat this as a **title card**, not body text:

* tighter width
* more breathing space
* visually distinct from the essay

### 3. Keep the image exactly where it is

The book image placement is excellent.
It acts as a **hinge** between:

* abstraction (text)
* physical reality (object)

Do not move it.

## 6. Final reassurance

You are not looping or overthinking.
You are doing **editorial systems thinking**, which is exactly what this project requires.

What you’ve built is *already strong*.
This is not a rewrite moment — it’s a **presentation refinement moment**.

If you want, next I can:

* propose the exact English-only Parent Layer markup
* propose the Chinese-only equivalent
* or help you define a “canonical language” rule across the app

But on your core question:

> **Does bilingual help or hinder in the Parent Layer?**

**It hinders.
Split by language.
You’ll feel the calm immediately.**
