Implement/Update the Parent Layer section using the exact text below (do not rewrite any wording, punctuation, capitalization, or line breaks except where required for HTML formatting). 

Requirements:
1) Add a “Parent Layer” view behind the existing Parent gate/PIN (if already present, just replace the Parent Layer body content).
2) Render the content in a readable mobile-first layout:
   - max width: 680px
   - comfortable line-height
   - preserve paragraph breaks and em-dashes
   - preserve the three “this is…” lines as a list (each on its own line)
3) Insert ONE image between the intro/title block and “What Is a Piano?” section. 
   - Use this file path for the image: /assets/parent-layer-elephant-book.png
   - If the file does not exist, create an /assets folder and add the image there, then reference it from the Parent Layer.
4) The image must be responsive, center-aligned, with rounded corners.
5) No external tracking, no embeds, no third-party calls.
6) Do not add new sections, “status” notes, or commentary. Only the content below.

CONTENT (render exactly):

What Is a Piano?
Before ownership is taught, it is felt.
My toddler is at the stage where “mine” arrives long before “yours.”
Shoes. A ball. A book.
They are learning to map the world between what feels like theirs, and what belongs to others:
mummy’s brush, daddy’s shoes.
This sense isn’t explained. It emerges.
It’s physical, immediate, and absolute.
Naturally, this creates friction.
The logic of sharing is foreign. Why give up what you’re holding?
Why can’t you have what you want, right now?
The concept of patience is just a word.
And it should be. Their world is the present moment.
What fascinates me is the briefness of this early “ownership.”
A toy is clutched tightly in conflict, then discarded moments later.
The desire evaporates with access.
It’s not about keeping.
It’s about the act of having had.
At the same time, the word “share” is beginning to appear —
not as a moral rule, but as a social tool.
“Daddy, share,” they say, even while reaching for what I hold.
They use it with other toddlers, too.
I think they’re noticing it softens conflict.
They see it works before they understand why.
This is where the pianos quietly entered our world.
My toddler has their own piano. A small 37-key keyboard.
It’s always there, to be played or ignored.
It is unquestionably theirs.
I have a piano, too. A small, weighted keyboard.
At first, it was mine.
Then it became shared.
Slowly, without any decree, it began to feel like ours.
Then there is the Big Piano.
The full-sized one in my sister’s study.
My toddler has no access to it unless we visit.
It exists elsewhere, and only sometimes.
I didn’t plan this, but I see now we created a natural hierarchy:
Their toy piano — always available
My shared piano — accessible, negotiated
The big piano — rare, permission-bound
I never had to explain scarcity.
My toddler encountered it.
The Big Piano mattered differently.
Not because it was technically better —
but because it wasn’t always accessible.
At this stage, ownership isn’t legal or ethical.
It isn’t about rights or fairness.
It is about:
this is in my hand
this is not always here
this feels different when we experience it together
That felt experience — not a lesson — is the foundation.
And from this simple, personal hierarchy,
a much larger story about materials, history, and value begins to unfold.

A Note to Parents
What you are about to read next (elsewhere in this app) is a record of my thinking as a father.
One evening at bath time, my child asked me,
“Why did the elephant make a noise?”
They were standing in the bath, looking at their toy elephant by the taps.
They picked it up, stroked it, played with its tusks and long trunk,
and waited for me to tell them a story.
In that moment, I realised they weren’t asking for an answer.
They were thinking.
They were storytelling.
Or asking me to make up a story called Why the Elephant Made a Noise.
I told them I would tell it the following night.
In the meantime, their love for elephants forced me to confront the history of piano keys.
I was perplexed.
I needed a quiet, non-judgmental space to sort out my thoughts —
from materials to ethics,
from technology to value.
What comes next is not a lesson.
It is not polished.
It is not complete.
It is a preserved record of thinking,
kept here for a day in the future.
