Got it — you’re asking **what is the best way to represent the future PDF in the code right now**, without actually adding the PDF or changing the document.

### Best practice (clean, reversible, zero semantic drift)

Use a **single, inert placeholder line in HTML**, commented out or visually muted, that can be activated later **without touching the text above it**.

You have two good options. I recommend **Option A**.

---

## ✅ Option A (Recommended): Commented placeholder (invisible, safest)

This keeps the Parent Layer **pure** and avoids any UI implication until you’re ready.

```html
<!--
Future addition:
<a href="/assets/what-is-a-piano-thinking-record.pdf" class="parent-pdf-link">
  Read the archived thinking record (PDF)
</a>
-->
```

**Why this is best**

* Zero visual footprint
* No implied promise to the user
* No wording commitment yet
* One-line enable later (remove the comment)

This matches your philosophy: *some answers are not yet available*.

---

## ✅ Option B: Muted, disabled text (visible but inactive)

If you want parents to *sense* something exists without accessing it yet:

```html
<p class="parent-pdf-placeholder">
  Archived thinking record (PDF) — available later
</p>
```

With CSS:

```css
.parent-pdf-placeholder {
  opacity: 0.45;
  font-size: 0.9rem;
  margin-top: 16px;
}
```

**Use this only if** you want to signal future depth without opening it.

---

## ❌ What I would NOT do

* ❌ A live link that goes nowhere
* ❌ “Coming soon” banners
* ❌ Buttons
* ❌ Icons
* ❌ Any copy that frames it as instructional or required

Those all break the restraint you’ve worked so hard to maintain.

---

## Final recommendation (clear answer)

**Use Option A: the commented HTML link.**

It:

* respects the document
* respects the reader
* respects your timing
* keeps the Parent Layer *complete in its incompleteness*

When you’re ready, you’ll know — and you’ll uncomment one line.

If you want, next I can:

* lock the exact filename/path you should use later
* or help you design the *moment* the link appears (without changing the text)

But right now:
**you’re doing this exactly right.**
