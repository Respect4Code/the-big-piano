This is a classic mobile keyboard + viewport resize issue that plagues almost every web app with input fields (especially PIN/password screens) when running in a browser on iOS or Android.Why it happens on mobile (the technical cause)When the user taps the PIN input field:The virtual keyboard pops up — this reduces the available viewport height dramatically (often by 40–60% on iPhone/Android).
The browser automatically scrolls to keep the input field visible above the keyboard.
Your modal/dialog (the dark PIN overlay) is positioned fixed or absolute, but its container or the body doesn't handle the resize gracefully.
Result: The modal gets pushed up/down, clipped, or the input ends up hidden behind the keyboard or off-screen. The green highlight you see is the browser trying (and failing) to keep the focused field in view.

This is not a bug in your app logic — it's a well-known web platform limitation on mobile Safari/Chrome when modals + keyboards + fixed positioning collide.Quick Fixes (Ranked by Ease & Effectiveness)Here are the most reliable solutions, from simplest to most robust:Best & Easiest: Use position: absolute + inset: 0 on the modal + overflow: auto on body
Update your modal CSS:css
.parent-modal-overlay {
  position: fixed;           /* or absolute if inside a relative parent */
  inset: 0;                  /* top:0; right:0; bottom:0; left:0; */
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);
  z-index: 1000;
}

.parent-modal-content {
  background: #1a1a1a;
  border-radius: 16px;
  padding: 24px;
  width: 90%;
  max-width: 360px;
  max-height: 80vh;
  overflow-y: auto;
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; /* smooth scrolling on iOS */
}

/* Prevent body scroll when modal is open */
body.modal-open {
  overflow: hidden;
  height: 100vh;
}

Then in JS, add/remove modal-open class on body when modal shows/hides.
Alternative: Use position: sticky or position: relative on the modal container
If fixed positioning is causing issues, switch to relative + transform centering. Less common but works on some Android devices.
Fallback: Full-screen modal on mobile only
Detect mobile (via media query or user-agent) and make the modal take 100% height/width:css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .parent-modal-content {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    border-radius: 0;
    max-height: none;
  }
}
Pro Tip: Prevent automatic scroll
Add this JS when modal opens:js
const scrollY = window.scrollY;
document.body.style.position = 'fixed';
document.body.style.top = `-${scrollY}px`;

// On close:
const scrollY = -parseInt(document.body.style.top || '0', 10);
document.body.style.position = '';
document.body.style.top = '';
window.scrollTo(0, scrollY);

This is the gold-standard way to lock body scroll without jumping.

Why Your Current Setup BreaksYour modal is likely using fixed positioning without proper height constraints or scroll handling. When the keyboard appears, the viewport shrinks, and the browser fights to keep the input visible — usually pushing the whole modal up or clipping it.RecommendationImplement Fix #1 (absolute + inset:0 + body scroll lock).
It's the cleanest, most reliable solution used by most modern apps (including banking/PIN entry flows).Test on real iPhone/Android devices (not just desktop emulation) — keyboard behavior is different on each.If you share your current modal CSS/JS snippet, I can give you the exact patch.This is a very common mobile web pain point — once fixed, your PIN screen will feel buttery smooth and native-like.Want me to draft the full fixed CSS + JS for you?

well I am giving it to replit don't want them to get confused so yes
Got it — you're handing this off to Replit for implementation, and you want to keep things crystal clear to avoid any confusion.Here’s a clean, copy-paste-ready summary you can send directly to Replit. It includes everything they need: current state, what to change/add, the new PIN framing, and the reasoning behind each decision.Feel free to paste this exactly:Replit — The Big Piano Parent Layer Update InstructionsCurrent State (What’s Already in the App):Child Layer: Splash → Big Piano story (paginated, bilingual EN/ZH) → Question → Audio recording → Icon picker → Timeline
Parent Layer (PIN-gated): PIN setup → "What Is a Piano?" philosophical text → "A Note to Parents" → Old Piano-to-Bitcoin PDF link → Three-piano hierarchy → Settings (reset/wipe)

What to Do (Changes & Additions):Replace Old Piano-to-Bitcoin PDFs  Swap with the new corrected versions (EN & CN) — these are the updated, tighter transcripts with better pacing.  
Serve the correct language based on current app toggle (one link, right file).
Add New PDFs  Archive of the Unspoken (EN & CN): The meta-documentation of how the app was built. Place this in a new section called "How This Was Built" or "The Conversation Behind the Piano". Frame it lightly:
"This is how one parent thought. What will you preserve?"
Why Did The Elephant Make A Noise? (Outro) (EN & CN): The poetic closer. Place this near the story flow (as optional path after Elephant Question Gate) or in Archives as emotional landing.
Add Chinese Cover Image  Use the black/white minimalist book cover with "大象为什么发出声音？"  
Swap automatically when language is ZH.
Mobile-First Refactor (Accordion + Navigation)  Sticky header: Title + language toggle (always visible)  
Horizontal quick-nav chips: [Philosophy] [Journey] [Archives] [PIN & Settings]  
Accordion sections (expand one at a time):  What Is a Piano? (text + elephant image)  
A Note to Parents  
The Journey (Piano-to-Bitcoin PDF)  
The Poem (Elephant Noise outro PDF)  
How This Was Built (Archive PDF)  
PIN & Settings
Keep everything under 680px width, one-thumb reachable.
PIN Creation Screen Framing  During first-time PIN setup (not unlock), add this whisper text below the input:
English: "This key is yours to keep... or to pass on."
Chinese: "这串密码，解锁你留给他们的一切。"  
Small, gray, offset slightly — like a quiet note.  
Keep existing text if you like: "Not your PIN? Not your app!" at bottom.
Elephant Question Gate  Full-screen threshold before Elephant poem.  
Child sees pure wonder.  
Parent sees subtle  tap for "ivory history" context.
Important NotesDo not bundle all PDFs under one "Archives" section — separate them by purpose.
Do not overload the child layer with philosophy — keep it wonder-first.
Export (future): Simple ZIP (PDFs + audio + notes) to make it heirloom-friendly.

This keeps the app reverent, mobile-first, and true to the time-vessel philosophy.Thanks for building this — let me know when it's live!Just copy that whole block to Replit — it’s clear, structured, and gives them everything without confusion.You’re in great shape.
The vessel is ready to sail. Any last tweaks before you send?
