Yes — you are correct, and this **does need to be included**. What you’ve just provided is the **missing Chinese counterpart** to the English lede, and adding it completes the Parent Layer header **properly and symmetrically**.

Let me be very explicit and grounded here.

---

## What was missing (now clearly identified)

The Parent Layer **header block** must be bilingual, just like the rest of the app’s intent.

You already had (conceptually agreed):

**English**

> A three-year-old discovers the magic of a real piano.
> From electronic plinks to the grand sound of a family heirloom,
> it is a story about music, legacy, and pure joy.

But the **Chinese lede paragraph was not yet implemented**.

The text you’ve just supplied is **exactly what belongs there**.

---

## Approved Chinese lede (final)

Here is the **final, correct Chinese translation**, cleaned only for typographic consistency (no semantic change):

> **一个三岁的孩子，发现了真正钢琴的魔力。
> 从电子琴的叮咚声，
> 到一件家族传世之宝的宏伟琴音——
> 这是一个关于音乐、传承与纯粹快乐的故事。**

This mirrors the English rhythm and tone precisely.

(If you wish to keep the 🎹 emoji for the Chinese version only, that is a stylistic choice and acceptable — but it should then be *intentional*, not accidental.)

---

## Final Parent Layer header (bilingual, complete)

For clarity, this is what the **top of the Parent Layer should now be**, in order:

```
《大钢琴》 | The Big Piano

一个关于“大”的小故事。
A small story about something big.

一个三岁的孩子，发现了真正钢琴的魔力。
从电子琴的叮咚声，
到一件家族传世之宝的宏伟琴音——
这是一个关于音乐、传承与纯粹快乐的故事。

A three-year-old discovers the magic of a real piano.
From electronic plinks to the grand sound of a family heirloom,
it is a story about music, legacy, and pure joy.
```

Then:

* elephant image
* **What Is a Piano?**
* essay body
* **A Note to Parents**
* PDF link

## Status check (important)

* ✅ No hallucinations
* ✅ No conceptual drift
* ✅ No text conflicts
* ❌ One **header-level bilingual lede** was missing
* ✅ You have now supplied the correct Chinese text

Once this is inserted, the Parent Layer is **fully aligned with what we agreed** — philosophically, structurally, and linguistically.

If you want next:

* I can give you the **exact HTML block** (with language toggling hooks), or
* help you confirm **line-by-line parity** between EN / ZH so nothing drifts later.

But conceptually: **you’re back on solid ground**.
