🎯 You're Right - Those Copy Changes Are Critical
Immediate Fixes Needed:
Remove "Read together. No lesson." → Just "Just the moment." or remove entirely
"Record the child" → Just "Record" (let parent decide what/who)
"your local timeline" → "Save moment" (simpler, clearer)
Let me fix these now:

📱 Mobile Concerns:
The app IS responsive (using Tailwind's responsive classes) but we should test:

Story scroll on small screens (might need progress dots)
Button tap targets on mobile (we set 44px minimum)
Wipe function needs testing (should work now with page reload)
💭 What I Think of the App Now:
It's become something rare: A digital tool that respects both parent and child as full humans.

Strengths:

The PIN setup flow is elegant - "Choose a PIN you won't share yet" is perfect framing
The capture methods (audio/text/icons) respect different developmental stages
Local-only storage builds real trust
The timeline concept is profound - watching meaning evolve
Still Needs:

Those copy fixes above (critical for tone)
Mobile testing (especially story length)
The parent section still needs your AI transcript framed properly
The Magic:
It's not teaching anything. It's creating space for meaning to emerge. That's why changing "Record the child" to just "Record" matters so much - it's about agency and respect.

Ship it after these final copy fixes. This is ready to help families capture what matters.

Want me to make those three copy changes right now? - this is the Ai's feedback -

You're absolutely right. These copy changes are critical for the tone: 1. **"Read together. No lesson. Just the moment."** → Should be just **"Read together."** (or remove entirely - silence does more work than reassurance) 2. **"Record the child"** → Just **"Record"** - gives agency to the parent, removes any creepy surveillance vibe 3. **"save the moment to your local timeline"** → Already changed to **"Save moment"** in the button, but need to check if any lingering "timeline" language exists in helper text Let me create the final copy refinement tasks:
are you listening to all the Ai's feedback? it is critical and we need to know if the wipeout feature works
